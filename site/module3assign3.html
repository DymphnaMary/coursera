        <h4 id="h1">Atomic habits</h2>
        <p >
            <b>The Book in Three Sentences</b>
            An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but is also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.
            Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
            Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.<br>
           <b><I>The Five Big Ideas</I> </b>
            Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
            If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
            The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
            The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.
            Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.    <br>
            

            “Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.”

            “You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.”

            “Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.”

            “Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.”

          “Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.”           

            “If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.”

         “Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.”                

         If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed what James calls, “Plateau of Latent Potential.”

        <h4 id="h2">Ikigai</h2>
        <p >
            Stay active; don’t retire.
            Take it slow.
            Don’t fill your stomach.
            Surround yourself with good friends.
            Get in shape for your next birthday.
            Smile.
            Reconnect with nature.
            Give thanks.
            Live in the moment.
            Follow your ikigai. <br> 
            “There is a tension between what is good for someone and what they want to do.
            “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing:
             in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.”  
             “essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to 
             love, and something to hope for.”<br>
             I recently completed reading a very inspiring book — IKIGAI — The Japanese Secret to a Long Happy Life. <br>The book is authored by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles. In this article, I am going to talk about my learning from the book.
The book touches the various aspects of life which can help us achieve a long happy life. It is based on ancient, well practised Japanese technique called — IKIGAI.

<b>IKIGAI</b>
If you google the word, you will get various meanings like
A reason for being, encompassing joy, a sense of purpose and meaning and a feeling of well-being
Or
The word derives from iki, meaning life and kai, meaning the realisation of hopes and expectations.
But the one I liked the most is —
A reason to jump out of bed each morning!
This book draws a lot of references from an island in Japan called — Okinawa where there 24.5 inhabitants of age more
 100 for every 1,00,000 people.<br>



<b>Once you understand the meaning of the word Ikigai, the book tries to explain the deep art of staying young while growing old. It gives the references of 5 Blue Zones
     in the world where residents of these places live longer than average and secrets of their long life.</b>

Little Stress is good for you<br>

“A focused man working on a sticker-covered laptop in a coffee shop” by Tim Gouw on Unsplash<br>
In next chapter, book explains how stress, a lot sitting adds up to your age and makes reduces your life duration. Interesting it also mentions very prominently that little stress is good for you since it keeps you going. I firmly believe — Being Conscious of Your Daily Routine Can Lead to A Better Life!
Discover the meaning of your life<br>
In the subsequent chapter, it helps you deep dive into discovering the meaning of your life. It is quite evident that the authors stress more on discovering the meaning of life rather than creating one for you!
Finding flow in everything that you do<br>

This part is my most favourite where the authors helps you find the meaning of being in the flow. If you have discovered the meaning of your life, you need to completely immerse into the experience without being distracted by the surroundings and you attain the flow.
The book also talks about some very interesting techniques to practice which can help you achieve the flow.
Practising the techniques

The last section talks about collection of various different techniques which help you keep your mind and body intact. It talks about —
Meditation<br>
Yoga<br>
Surya Namaskara<br>
Radio Taiso<br>
Tai Chi<br>

Wabi Sabi<br>
The book concludes after introducing to another Japanese Technique called — Wabi-Sabi. 
This techniques talks about finding beauty in imperfect, incomplete things. Here flawed is 
preferred over perfection. Japanese believe that only imperfect, incomplete and ephemeral 
things are beautiful because they resemble the nature.<br>
Conclusion<br>
To conclude, I think the book is extremely inspiring and full of content. I could attain my flow while reading it. 
Loved it ! Highly recommended reading — You can buy the book on Amazon!<br>

        <h4 id="h3">How to talk to anyone</h2>
        
        <p ><center>There are two kinds of people in this life:
            Those who walk into a room and say,“Well, here I am!”
            And those who walk in and say,“Ahh, there you are.”<br></center>
            
            <b>Technique #1</b> - The Flooding Smile.
            Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of 
            sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. S
            oak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your
             eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding
              smile is genuine and only for them.<br>
            
              <b>Technique #2</b> -Sticky Eyes
            Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation partner’s with sticky warm taffy. Don’t break eye
             contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly,
              reluctantly, stretching the gooey taffy until the tiny string finally breaks.<br>
            
              <b>Technique #3</b> - Epoxy Eyes
            This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. 
            No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or woman you want to impact.<br>
            
            <b>Technique #4</b> - Hang by Your Teeth
            Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through.
             Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the big top. 
             When you hang by your teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position.<br>
            
             <b>Technique #5</b> - The Big-Baby Pivot
            Give everyone you meet The Big-Baby Pivot. The instant the two of you are introduced,
             reward your new acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided 
             attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to your feet, turned a precious face up to yours,
              and beamed a big toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent toward the new person shouts “I think you are very, very special.”<br>
            
              <b>Technique #6</b> - Hello Old Friend
            When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone
             else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicissitudes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy
              mackerel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend! 
              The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening
               of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes—and everything between.<br>
            
               <b>Technique #7</b> - Limit the Fidget
            Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. 
            Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your puss.
             Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re fibbing.<br>

            
             <b>Technique #8</b>- Hans’s Horse Sense
            Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how
             your listener is reacting to what you’re saying. Then plan your moves accordingly. If a horse can 
             do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You’ve got horse sense.<br>
            
             <b>Technique #9</b>- Watch the Scene Before You Make the Scene
            Rehearse being the Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. SEE yourself walking around with Hang by 
            Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. HEAR yourself chatting
             comfortably with everyone. FEEL the pleasure of knowing you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating toward you.
              VISUALIZE yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens automatically.<br>
            
              <b>Technique #10</b> - Make a Mood Match
            Before opening your mouth, take a “voice sample” of your listener to detect his
             or her state of mind. Take a “psychic photograph” of the expression to see if your
              listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around
               to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.<br>
